- 👋 Hi, I’m @FantomusVerus
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, making money, nerd stuff, army stuff, and working out...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and control systems among various other things...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will make me a better programmer / software enginneer / you name it,
      or will teach me a valuable skill / information on the field of electrical engineering or computer science.
- 📫 How to reach me: Well i guess you can't, since this isn't my official account, but if you really want to, you can try sending me an email at darthinhilus@gmail.com
        Don't get your hopes up though, i'm probably not going to respond, but you never know, no promises.
